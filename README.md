# Reflection

Reflect on what you have achieved so far in this course and answer the following questions:

## The Journey so Far

* 1.	What have you learned so far? 

I’ve learned the basics (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and create my own website using bootstrap and API’s. Moving to more complicated / non-static website using Node.js, express and databases. 

* 2.	What have you accomplished?

Creating website was a huge accomplishment to me. Before I started the bootcamp, even though I had a Java background, I did not know how to create a simple website. 

* 3.	Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?

I am more stressed out right now, I guess. But I believe that is part of growing and learning new things. 

## Path to Success

* 1.	What are your goals for the remainder of the course? 

My main goal is to stay focus and continue my hard work so I can finish the course.

* 2.	What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes? 

I hope to be better on my coding and job interview skills.

* 3.	What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?

I hope to find a job that is related the course I am taking. 

* 4.	What strategies will you employ to ensure you accomplish these goals?

Spencer and the TA’s are very helpful at this bootcamp. I will continue to seek help and learn so I can build a foundation that will help me on my future interviews.

* 5.	How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?

I thought having a good code or building a nice website was enough, I did not know that the Interview part is a whole new skill that I needed to practice/ learn.
